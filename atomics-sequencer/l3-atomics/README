This program measures the rate at which a single CPU core can atomically modify
cachelines in L3. This information may be useful in reasoning about the
maximum atomics rate of an HCA that uses PCIe atomics to implement RDMA atomics.

A ballpark rate of a CPU core's L3 atomic rate is 50 M/s. These atomics are
serialized by the core (by making successive atomic operations dependent)
on each other.
